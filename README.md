## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

Anaconda 4.5.11 distribution
Python 3.6

Full details of library are written on requirements.txt

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interested in Boston Air BNB data to understand:

1. How each neighborhood in Boston performing in terms of ratings?
2. How is superhost affecting the ratings?
3. What is the biggest contributing factors to ratings?


The full set of files related to this course are owned by Udacity, so they are not publicly available here.  However, you can see pieces of the analysis here.  This README also serves as a template for students to follow in creating their own project README files.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 2 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions. 

1. Neighborhood_performance.ipynb : This notebook provide analysis for question no 1 : How each neighborhood in Boston performing in terms of ratings? 
2. Quality_listing.ipynb : This notebook provide analysis for question no 2 and 3, and also prediction modeling for ratings.


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@o.dwisaputro/how-to-check-good-airbnb-listing-8a5cb7354f2d)

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to AirBNB for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/Boston/).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
